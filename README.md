# The First Project Landing Page (Udacity Course)
## Initial project requirements
###### 1- The project should have a structure like the one shown below. All files shown must be present and the app must successfully render a home page with clear design and functionality added when index.html is loaded in the browser. No errors should display in console.
- css
- - styles.css    
- index.html
- js
- - app.js
- README.md
###### 2- All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.
###### 3- Styling has been added for active states.
###### 4- There are at least 4 sections that have been added to the page.

## Landing Page Behavior
###### 1- Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list. Start with empty ul and dynamically build navigation using Append, appendChild, and innerHTML.

###### 2- It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.

###### 3- When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.

## Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!

###### 1- Add an active state to your navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
###### 2- Add a scroll to top button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.
###### 3- Update/change the design/content.
###### 4- Make sections collapsible.
